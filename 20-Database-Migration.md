### **Database Migration**

**Database migration** is the process of transferring data between different systems, whether from one database to another or from on-premise to the cloud.

### **Key Steps in Database Migration**:

1. **Planning**  
   - Assess goals and compatibility between source and target systems.

2. **Data Mapping**  
   - Map source data fields to corresponding target fields.

3. **Migration Strategy**  
   - **Big Bang**: Migrate all data at once.
   - **Phased**: Migrate in stages.

4. **Data Transformation**  
   - Convert data formats, types, and schemas as needed.

5. **Testing**  
   - Perform dry runs to ensure data integrity and system performance.

6. **Execution**  
   - Migrate data with minimal downtime.

7. **Post-Migration**  
   - Validate data and monitor system performance.

### **Visual: Migration Flow**

```
[Source DB] → [Data Mapping] → [Data Transformation] → [Target DB]
                     ↑                              ↓
             [Testing] ←───→ [Execution] ←───→ [Post-Migration Validation]
```

### **Challenges in Migration**:

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring no loss or corruption of data.
- **Downtime**: Minimizing system unavailability during migration.
- **Compatibility**: Addressing differences between source and target systems.
- **Performance**: Post-migration tuning of the new system.

### **Types of Database Migration**:

1. **Homogeneous Migration**: Same DBMS (e.g., Oracle to Oracle).
2. **Heterogeneous Migration**: Different DBMS (e.g., MySQL to MongoDB).
3. **Cloud Migration**: On-premise to cloud solutions (e.g., AWS, Azure).
4. **Database Upgrade**: Moving to a newer version of the same DBMS.

### **Summary**:

- **Database migration** ensures data is moved smoothly to a new system or platform.
- Steps: **Plan**, **Map**, **Transform**, **Test**, **Migrate**, **Validate**.
- Key challenges: **Data integrity**, **downtime**, and **compatibility**.
