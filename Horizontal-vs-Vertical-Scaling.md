## Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
- **Definition**: Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server.
- **When to Use**:
  - Small to medium workloads.
  - Simple applications that don’t require high availability.
  - Short-term growth before considering more complex scaling.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and quick to implement.
  - Doesn’t require significant changes to application architecture.
- **Cons**:
  - Physical limits (you can only add so much to one machine).
  - Can become costly and inefficient at scale.

### Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)
- **Definition**: Adding more servers to distribute the load across multiple machines.
- **When to Use**:
  - Large-scale systems needing high availability or handling large traffic volumes.
  - Systems requiring redundancy and fault tolerance (e.g., cloud-based systems).
- **Pros**:
  - Scalable without fixed limits.
  - Better fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Cons**:
  - More complex setup (requires load balancing, distributed databases).
  - Requires architectural changes (e.g., microservices, service discovery).

**Key Takeaway**:  
- **Vertical Scaling** is simpler but limited in scalability.
- **Horizontal Scaling** is more complex but offers better long-term scalability, availability, and fault tolerance.
