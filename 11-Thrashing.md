### **What is Thrashing?**

**Definition**:  
Thrashing occurs when the system spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than executing processes, causing **severe CPU utilization drops**.

---

### **Why Does Thrashing Happen?**

1. **High Degree of Multiprogramming**:
   - Adding more processes to the system increases CPU utilization **up to a point**.
   - However, if too many processes are running, the **memory becomes over-committed**, leading to excessive paging.

2. **Page Faults**:
   - A process needs more memory (frames) than available, so it starts **faulting** (page faults).
   - The system swaps pages in and out, but if the swapping takes too long, CPU utilization drops.

3. **Increased Swapping and Faulting**:
   - As new processes are added to compensate for low CPU utilization, they start **stealing frames** from each other.
   - This causes even more **page faults** and **increased waiting time** for the paging device.
   - The cycle continues until CPU utilization falls to **nearly 0%**.

### **Visualizing Thrashing**

Imagine a graph where:

- **X-axis**: Degree of multiprogramming (number of processes)
- **Y-axis**: CPU utilization

| **Degree of Multiprogramming** | **CPU Utilization**  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Low (few processes)            | Moderate to high     |
| Increasing processes            | CPU utilization increases slowly |
| Beyond a certain point          | **Thrashing begins**—CPU utilization drops sharply to near zero |

---

### **What Happens During Thrashing?**

- **Page Faults Increase**: The processes cannot get the memory they need, so they keep waiting for pages to be swapped in and out.
- **CPU Spends More Time on Paging**: More CPU cycles are consumed handling the paging mechanism than executing the actual processes.
- **System Becomes Inefficient**: Overall system throughput drops, and the performance degrades.

### **How to Prevent or Minimize Thrashing**

1. **Priority Replacement Algorithm** (Local Replacement):
   - Limits the ability of one process to steal frames from another, thus preventing **cascading thrashing**.

2. **Working Set Model**:
   - **Working Set**: Set of pages actively used by a process within a specific window (Δ).
   - The **working set strategy** ensures that processes only need the frames they are actively using, minimizing unnecessary paging.

   **Formula for Working Set**:
   \[
   D = \sum WSS_i
   \]
   Where:
   - \( D \) = Total frame demand from all processes.
   - \( WSS_i \) = Working set size for process \( i \).

3. **Adjust the Degree of Multiprogramming**:
   - Keep track of processes’ memory requirements and reduce the number of processes if thrashing is detected.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Thrashing occurs** when the system spends more time paging than executing.
- **High multiprogramming** can lead to thrashing if processes don't have enough frames.
- Thrashing can be **mitigated** using:
  - **Priority replacement algorithms** (local replacement).
  - **Working set models** that optimize frame allocation based on process locality.

---

### **Summary**

Thrashing is caused by excessive page faults when the degree of multiprogramming is too high. To prevent it:
- Minimize the number of processes.
- Use **priority replacement** and the **working set model** to allocate memory more efficiently.
