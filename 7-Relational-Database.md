### **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**

- **Definition**: A relational database stores data in tables with rows and columns, using relationships between tables to organize and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Data Structure**: Data is stored in **tables** (also called **relations**), where:
  - **Rows** represent records.
  - **Columns** represent attributes or fields of the records.
- **Primary Key**: Each table has a unique **primary key** that identifies each record.
- **Foreign Key**: Tables are linked using **foreign keys** that reference primary keys in other tables, establishing relationships.
- **SQL**: Data is manipulated and queried using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.
- **ACID Properties**: Relational databases follow **ACID** principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable transactions.
- **Examples**: Common RDBMS include **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**.

### **Summary**:
Relational databases organize data into tables, use keys for relationships, and allow data manipulation through SQL, ensuring reliable and structured data storage.
