### **Pull vs Push: Key Differences**

**1. Definition:**
- **Pull**: The client requests data from the server when needed.
- **Push**: The server sends data to the client automatically when new updates are available.

---

**2. How It Works:**

- **Pull**:
  - Client actively asks for data.
  - Example: **HTTP Requests**—Client sends a request, and the server responds with data.
  - Use case: **Web Browsing**, **API requests**.

- **Push**:
  - Server sends data to the client automatically.
  - Example: **WebSockets**, **Push Notifications**—Server sends updates without client request.
  - Use case: **Real-time chat**, **Live updates**.

---

**3. Advantages and Disadvantages:**

- **Pull**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Simple and stateless.
    - Client controls when data is fetched.
  - **Cons**:
    - Can create unnecessary load (polling) if too frequent.
    - Latency in getting updates (depends on request intervals).

- **Push**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Real-time data delivery.
    - More efficient for live or event-driven systems.
  - **Cons**:
    - More complex to implement.
    - Can overload the client if too many updates are sent.

---

**4. Example Scenarios:**

- **Pull**:
  - **APIs**: A client queries an API for data periodically.
  - **Web Browsing**: The browser pulls data from the server when loading pages.

- **Push**:
  - **Push Notifications**: A messaging app pushes new messages to the user's device.
  - **Live Data Feeds**: Sports apps push real-time scores to the user.

**5. Visual Comparison:**

```
Pull:
[Client] <-- (Request) <-- [Server] <-- (Response) --> [Client]

Push:
[Server] -- (Push Data) --> [Client]
```

---

**6. Choosing Between Pull and Push:**

- Use **Pull** when:
  - Data doesn't change often or is requested on-demand.
  - Simple interactions are enough (e.g., API calls).

- Use **Push** when:
  - Real-time data delivery is required (e.g., chat apps, live updates).
  - You want the server to notify clients instantly without them asking.

---

**Summary:**
- **Pull** is client-initiated, ideal for periodic requests.
- **Push** is server-initiated, ideal for real-time, event-driven systems.
