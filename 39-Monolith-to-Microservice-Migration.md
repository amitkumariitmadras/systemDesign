### **Moving from Monoliths to Microservices**

#### **Key Points for Migration:**

1. **Contract**:  
   - Define clear service contracts for communication between microservices (e.g., API contracts via REST or gRPC).
  
2. **Router**:  
   - Implement an **API Gateway** to manage routing, load balancing, and security between services (e.g., **Kong**, **Nginx**).

3. **Simplify Deployments**:  
   - Use **CI/CD pipelines** for smooth, continuous deployment of individual services, allowing independent deployments.

4. **Communication**:  
   - Choose appropriate communication patterns: **synchronous** (REST/gRPC) for real-time, or **asynchronous** (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupling.

5. **Logging**:  
   - Set up **centralized logging** (e.g., **ELK stack**, **Prometheus**) and **distributed tracing** to track requests across services.

### **Summary of Steps to Migrate**:
1. **Define Service Boundaries**: Break monolith into logical services.
2. **Start with One Service**: Migrate a single module (e.g., user service) to a microservice.
3. **Gradual Refactoring**: Incrementally migrate other parts of the monolith.
4. **Manage Data**: Use event-driven patterns for data consistency across services.

### **Example**:
- **Monolith**: A single app handling user authentication, product catalog, and checkout.
- **Microservices**: Separate services for **User Management**, **Catalog**, and **Checkout**, each deployed independently.
