# System Design Overview

System design is about planning and building systems that are scalable, reliable, and efficient. Below are some key concepts and patterns in system design, explained briefly with an example of a **video streaming service** (e.g., YouTube).

---

## 1. Vertical Scaling
**Vertical scaling** involves adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server to handle increased load.

- **Example**: Upgrade your video server from 8 GB RAM to 32 GB RAM to handle more users.
- **Limitations**: Physical limits and high cost.

---

## 2. Preprocessing Using Cron Jobs
**Cron jobs** are scheduled tasks that run at specific intervals to automate background tasks like data cleanup or reports.

- **Example**: Run a daily cron job to refresh video metadata or clean up expired content.

---

## 3. Backup Servers
Backup servers replicate data from the primary system to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.

- **Example**: Have secondary servers that can take over if the primary server fails, ensuring no downtime for users.

---

## 4. Horizontal Scaling
**Horizontal scaling** involves adding more servers to distribute the load.

- **Example**: Add more servers to handle increased video streaming traffic, instead of upgrading a single server.

---

## 5. Microservices
In **microservices architecture**, the system is divided into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.

- **Example**: Separate services for user authentication, video playback, and recommendations, allowing independent scaling.

---

## 6. Distributed Systems
A **distributed system** uses multiple computers to work together as a unified service, handling high traffic and redundancy.

- **Example**: Use multiple servers to store videos and data, ensuring better availability and fault tolerance.

---

## 7. Load Balancing
**Load balancing** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no server is overloaded.

- **Example**: A load balancer directs user requests to the least busy server, ensuring fast video streaming.

---

## 8. Decoupling
**Decoupling** means breaking down the system into independent components that can evolve or scale independently.

- **Example**: Decouple the user authentication service from video streaming, so they don’t affect each other.

---

## 9. Logging and Metrics Calculation
**Logging** tracks system events, and **metrics** provide aggregated data to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

- **Example**: Log user actions (e.g., "video started") and track metrics like average video load time to identify bottlenecks.

---

## 10. Extensibility
**Extensibility** means designing the system so that new features can be added easily without disrupting existing functionality.

- **Example**: Add a new feature for live streaming without affecting the core video playback service.

---

## 11. Low-Level System Design
Low-level design focuses on the specifics of individual components, like databases or storage systems.

- **Example**: Choose a distributed file system to store videos and optimize it for fast retrieval and low latency.

---

### Additional Concepts

- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure the system continues to function even if a part fails.
- **CAP Theorem**: A distributed system can only guarantee two of the following at once: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically locate and connect services in a distributed system.

This is a high-level overview of the most important system design concepts. As you build more systems, you’ll encounter and refine these principles further.
