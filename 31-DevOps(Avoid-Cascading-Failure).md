### How to Avoid Cascading Failures in Distributed Systems

Cascading failures can occur when a server is overwhelmed by too many requests, causing it to crash and affect other parts of the system. This is often seen in the **thundering herd problem**. Here are strategies to avoid cascading failures:

#### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Thundering Herd Problem**: 
   - Occurs when too many clients send requests simultaneously, overwhelming the server.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limit the number of requests a server can handle per second (QPS - Queries per second).
   - Helps manage load and prevents server overload.

3. **Request Throttling**:
   - Dropping or delaying excessive requests to ensure the server can handle incoming traffic efficiently.
   - Example: Rate limiting APIs, rejecting or delaying requests during peak times.

4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Aggregate and process requests in batches (e.g., cron jobs, job scheduling) to avoid overwhelming the server.
   
5. **Gradual Deployments**:
   - Deploy new features or updates gradually to avoid sudden spikes in traffic.

6. **Caching**:
   - Store frequently requested data in cache to reduce load on the primary servers.
   - **Cache Eviction Policies**: Set expiration times and cache limits to avoid stale data and unnecessary load.

7. **Message Queues**:
   - Use message queues like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to decouple services and smooth out traffic spikes by controlling how requests are handled.

#### **Visual Example**:
```
     +-------------------+                      +--------------------+
     |    Client Requests |                      |    Server Handling |
     |  (Multiple Requests)|---->Rate Limit----->|    (Capacity check)|
     +-------------------+                      +--------------------+
            |                                          |
            v                                          v
     +-------------------+            +-------------------------+
     | Throttled Requests |<---------->|  Message Queue/Batching |
     | (Dropped/Delayed)  |            | (Smooth Load Handling)  |
     +-------------------+            +-------------------------+
```

#### **Approaches to Mitigate Cascading Failures:**

1. **Predict Server Capacity**: Estimate how many requests the server can handle and apply limits (QPS).
2. **Use Message Queues**: To buffer and process requests over time, reducing immediate load.
3. **Prioritize Requests**: Handle high-priority requests first and delay or drop lower-priority ones.
4. **Use Caching**: Reduce repeated database hits by caching common requests or data.

#### **Advantages of These Techniques**:
- **Improved System Resilience**: Prevents system overloads and cascading failures.
- **Higher Availability**: Ensures the system can handle traffic spikes gracefully.
- **Better Performance**: Reduces latency and improves user experience.

### **Conclusion:**
By using **rate limiting**, **caching**, **batch processing**, and **message queues**, you can avoid cascading failures and maintain a high-performing and reliable distributed system.
